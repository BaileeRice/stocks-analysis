# stocks-analysis
## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:

Module 2's assignment is all about making the macro we created for Steve run faster, as well as making it a easier to read for potential edits made by us or another coder in the future

## RESULTS:
In 2017, I think it's fair to say the energy market was flourishing and many power companies saw huge net profits like DQ and SEDG(who saw almost 200% returns), for example:

In 2018, things seemed to be settling down back to a more 'stable' market price. At face value, you could've written off alot of these stocks if the table wasnt formatted to display both years, you wouldnt have ever known that the energy market as a whole SKYROCKETED the year before and now it's likely just settling(not tanking).

## SUMMARY:

pros
a glaring benifit to refactoring code is the neatness, being able to run things at a fraction of what they once ran at is always a plus 
cons
While it may be easy to read now, it likely wasnt easy to create(this assignment for example), compressing code and still keeping its integrity can be VERY time consuming, even with proper direction
